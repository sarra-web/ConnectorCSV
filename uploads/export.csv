Could books and art guide her to an alternative happy ending?</p><p>There are many things I didn’t do when I got divorced seven years ago at the age of 34: I didn’t set up a divorce registry; I didn’t throw my arms out behind me like wings while walking across a car park; I didn’t send an announcement that I was consciously uncoupling with a picture of me and my ex sitting on a lawn in happier times; I didn’t throw a party; I didn’t order a cake iced with “Boy, bye”; I didn’t erase all traces of my married life, burn love letters or throw my rings into the sea.</p><p>I don’t disapprove of these things – I laughed out loud when I came across the “Boy, bye” cake online recently, and if a paparazzo had cared he could have caught me dancing down the road that first divorcee summer – but what I most remember about that time was a feeling of plotlessness. I had chosen to come off the conventional path. What next? Not this, I kept saying, working my way slowly and haphazardly towards the things that did feel right. One of the first of those things was selling my wedding dress. I had felt beautiful in it, and though I didn’t want to wear it again, it wasn’t because it felt cursed. I could let it go. I feel happy when I think of someone else unknowingly giving that gown new life.

With the women’s game growing, the toxicity around men’s football, especially for travelling supporters, is an even more glaring contrast. As the season ends, the <em>Guardian</em> spoke to fans of clubs across the Premier League and EFL who reported offensive chants, language, behaviour and sexual assaults. For women, families, black, Asian and minority ethnic and LGBTQ+ fans, following their team on the road can be difficult and uncomfortable.</p><p>One female supporter spoke of experiencing sexual assaults regularly when following her team and going to other games with friends. “I’ve normalised it,” she said. “You’d think I’d turn around and call them out, but I didn’t. Last time, it was only [when] walking back to the car I said to my husband: ‘Oh yeah, that’s happened again.’ I should have been more horrified, but it happens all the time, particularly at away games where people have been drinking all day.

"I love electric vehicles – and was an early adopter. But increasingly I feel duped | Rowan Atkinson","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/03/electric-vehicles-early-adopter-petrol-car-ev-environment-rowan-atkinson","<p>Sadly, keeping your old petrol car may be better than buying an EV. There are sound environmental reasons not to jump just yet</p><p>Electric motoring is, in theory, a subject about which I should know something. My first university degree was in electrical and electronic engineering, with a subsequent master’s in control systems. Combine this, perhaps surprising, academic pathway with a lifelong passion for the motorcar, and you can see why I was drawn into an early adoption of electric vehicles. I bought my first electric hybrid 18 years ago and my first pure electric car nine years ago and (notwithstanding our poor electric charging infrastructure) have enjoyed my time with both very much. Electric vehicles may be a bit soulless, but they’re wonderful mechanisms: fast, quiet and, until recently, very cheap to run. But increasingly, I feel a little duped. When you start to drill into the facts, electric motoring doesn’t seem to be quite the environmental panacea it is claimed to be.</p><p>As you may know, the government has proposed a <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2020/nov/18/uk-ban-on-new-fossil-fuel-vehicles-by-2030-not-enough-to-hit-climate-targets"">ban on the sale of new petrol and diesel cars</a> from 2030. The problem with the initiative is that it seems to be based on conclusions drawn from only one part of a car’s operating life: what comes out of the exhaust pipe. Electric cars, of course, have zero exhaust emissions, which is a welcome development, particularly in respect of the air quality in city centres. But if you zoom out a bit and look at a bigger picture that includes the car’s manufacture, the situation is very different. In advance of the Cop26 climate conference in Glasgow in 2021, Volvo released figures claiming that greenhouse gas emissions during production of an electric car are<a href=""https://www.thisismoney.co.uk/money/cars/article-10161697/Volvo-says-electric-car-making-emissions-70-HIGHER-petrol.html""> 70% higher</a> than when manufacturing a petrol one. How so? The problem lies with the lithium-ion batteries fitted currently to nearly all electric vehicles: they’re absurdly heavy, many rare earth metals and huge amounts of energy are required to make them, and they only last about 10 years. It seems a perverse choice of hardware with which to lead the automobile’s fight against the climate crisis.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/03/electric-vehicles-early-adopter-petrol-car-ev-environment-rowan-atkinson"">Continue reading...</a>","Sat, 03 Jun 2023 07:00:24 GMT","https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/jun/03/electric-vehicles-early-adopter-petrol-car-ev-environment-rowan-atkinson"

The novelist had recently been diagnosed with breast cancer and King’s horror story was all her “chemo-brain” could cope with, she says on a video call from her home in Yorkshire. The story of a girl who gets telekinetic powers at puberty, Carrie was a favourite for Harris growing up. “Of course it was!” she exclaims. “It’s all about the drama of adolescence and the horror of having a changing body that does unpredictable stuff.”</p><p>Reading it again in her 50s she was struck by the idea: “What if Carrie had lived and her powers had kicked in at menopause instead? Nobody wants to give superpowers to a teenager, because of course they’re going to burn everything down.” And so she created Bernie Moon, who in middle age discovers she is able to inhabit other people’s minds and set them on a different course – predatory men become a particular target. “It’s menopausal Carrie,” she says gleefully. She started writing when she was ill (the effects of chemotherapy “were like the menopause but worse,” she says) and didn’t stop. She got the all-clear this Christmas: “So I thought: ‘OK, I’m feeling good about this.’”</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/03/all-the-rage-the-rise-of-the-menopause-novel"">Continue reading...</a>","Sat, 03 Jun 2023 08:00:25 GMT","https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/03/all-the-rage-the-rise-of-the-menopause-novel"

Or is it a candid look at sex today? As 2023’s most controversial series hits our screens, we meets its stars</p><p>Months before it had even come out, The Idol was the year’s most controversial TV show. In March, Rolling Stone published an exposé featuring anonymous interviews with those working on the Lily-Rose Depp-starring HBO show, who alleged that its producers – megastar musician Abel Tesfaye, AKA the Weeknd, who also plays a lecherous nightclub owner/cult leader called Tedros, and <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2019/aug/06/euphoria-review-zendaya-rue-sex-drugs-teen-drama-skins"">Euphoria</a>’s Sam Levinson – had burned through time and money to make a series “about a man who gets to abuse this woman and she loves it.”</p><p>Following a pop star named Jocelyn (Depp) as she tries to mount a career comeback after a mental breakdown, The Idol is self-consciously pulpy and undeniably sordid: characters talk about wanting to make “giant fucking big-titted hits”, lock intimacy coordinators in closets, and say over-the-top things such as: “Will you let people enjoy sex, drugs and hot girls? Stop trying to cockblock America.” Depp spends much of the first episode topless, and the series is littered with allusions to contentious cult auteurs such as Paul Verhoeven and Gaspar Noé. When the first two episodes premiered at Cannes earlier this month, <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/may/26/cannes-2023-peter-bradshaw-verdict-prize-predictions"">critics slammed it</a> as a “toxic man’s fantasy”; for a moment, its Rotten Tomatoes rating was hovering around an almost unheard-of 9% (it now sits at 25%).</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/02/im-not-used-to-seeing-sex-that-kinky-is-the-idol-the-most-shocking-tv-of-the-year"">Continue reading...</a>","Fri, 02 Jun 2023 12:00:02 GMT","https://www.theguardian.com/tv-and-radio/2023/jun/02/im-not-used-to-seeing-sex-that-kinky-is-the-idol-the-most-shocking-tv-of-the-year"

Captured during the Korean war of the early 1950s, the immobilised train pointing North has become a famous symbol of the frustrated yearning for reunification, a “commemorative fossil of the age of division”. The train is an underlying motif within Hwang Sok-yong’s mature masterpiece, a worker’s-eye view of the 20th-century history surrounding Korea’s partition, which draws deeply on his personal experience of labour and pro-democracy movements and his five-year stint in prison for breaching South Korean security laws by visiting the North in 1989.</p><p>Originally published in Korean in 2020, Mater 2-10 opens in the 21st century with a laid-off factory worker, Yi Jino, staging a vertiginous “sit-in” on the catwalk round an industrial chimney. In a mountaineering tent overlooking railway tracks, his sky-high protest stretches beyond a year, while far below workers prostrate themselves in solidarity.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/03/mater-2-10-by-hwang-sok-yong-review-a-masterpiece-of-korean-history"">Continue reading...</a>","Sat, 03 Jun 2023 06:30:23 GMT","https://www.theguardian.com/books/2023/jun/03/mater-2-10-by-hwang-sok-yong-review-a-masterpiece-of-korean-history"

Today, those three short words tend to denote the most confining limitations to queer characters in film, a trope and archetype designed to keep homosexuality on the sidelines, adjacent to the more palatable lives and loves of straight people. For a time, however, sassy support was about the best representation queer people could hope for on screen, even if it required some code-reading on the viewer’s part. In Code-era Hollywood, ascribing a sexuality at all to the waspish single man commenting on, or even assisting in, the protagonists’ own entanglement would have been a detail too far. He had a name, a role, a handful of good lines. What more could he want – an identity?</p><p>Curated by the critic Michael Koresky, a mini-season of films on the Criterion Channel in June affords some depth and dignity to a character often demeaned as a patronising relic of now-outdated prejudices – even as it persists in film and TV today. Koresky’s selection delves beyond the romantic comedy realm where the trope made its most enduring impression, and into the realist dramas, psycho-thrillers and unclassifiable art films (Irma Vep, most unexpectedly) through which the gay best friend has evolved from a type to a human being.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/02/gay-best-friend-history-hollywoods-favourite-queer-character"">Continue reading...</a>","Fri, 02 Jun 2023 16:00:06 GMT","https://www.theguardian.com/film/2023/jun/02/gay-best-friend-history-hollywoods-favourite-queer-character"

It’s a ruse, though. There are rules! Especially when it comes to the food.

And rule three: if you’re in a crowd, don’t be shy about making a plan – there are only so many crusty baguettes and pots of hummus that any group can eat.</p> <a href=""https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/03/picnic-and-camping-recipes-yotam-ottolenghi"">Continue reading...</a>","Sat, 03 Jun 2023 07:00:25 GMT","https://www.theguardian.com/food/2023/jun/03/picnic-and-camping-recipes-yotam-ottolenghi"
